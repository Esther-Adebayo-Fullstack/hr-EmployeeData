# hr-EmployeeData
The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning classifiers to predict employee churn within the HR department. By analyzing historical data encompassing various employee attributes, such as satisfaction level, last evaluation, number of projects, and other relevant features, we aim to develop a predictive model capable of identifying individuals likely to leave the organization. This predictive capability will aid HR in proactively addressing retention strategies, thereby mitigating the negative impact of employee turnover on organizational performance and culture.
